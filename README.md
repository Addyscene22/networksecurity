This project is a binary classification task aimed at detecting phishing websites using machine learning. It uses a dataset containing 48 features extracted from 10,000 webpages—5,000 phishing and 5,000 legitimate—collected using the Selenium WebDriver for accurate data extraction. The goal is to train a model that can distinguish between phishing and legitimate websites based on characteristics like URL structure, presence of HTTPS, external links, and other indicators. This can help in building reliable anti-phishing systems for web browsers, email filters, or cybersecurity tools.
